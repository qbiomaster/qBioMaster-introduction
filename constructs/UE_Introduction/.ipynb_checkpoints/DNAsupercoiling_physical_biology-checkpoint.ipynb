    "- Listen to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxREU4puGyc) on DNA topology, which will introduce linking number, writhe and twist.\n",
    "- Look at [this resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYGrElVyHnU) and then [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hwaDamU-jo) to learn about the roles of topoisomerases in changing DNA topology in the cell.\n",
    "- You can read this [tutorial by Valentin Rybenkov](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2016.00048/full) or listen to this [video by Paul Selvin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is16Lm7CQvk). These resources will describe the principles of magnetic tweezers, the measurement of forces and distances, and their use to manipulate and study DNA mechanics."
