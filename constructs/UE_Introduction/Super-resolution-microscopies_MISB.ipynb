    "- [The invention of PALM microscopy by Eric Betzig and Harold Hess (15')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcQ24khZzvU). This is a very instructive story of how SMLM was invented\n",
    "- [A course on STORM microscopy by X. Zhuang (0-30')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Qo__sppcI). This is an excellent resource to understand SMLM based on dye photophysics.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### SMLM\n",
    "- What is the typical resolution gain in SMLM? What does it depend on?\n",
    "- What are the properties that fluorophores need to have to be able to achieve SMLM?\n",
    "- What is the main difference between PALM and STORM? What are the relative advantages of one over the other?\n",
    "- Is the same resolution gained in all dimensions?\n",
    "- How is resolution measured?\n",
    "- What is the impact of labeling density?\n",
    "- Which approach is more suitable for live systems? What are the constrains of the live system that need to be considered?\n",
    "- If I have a choice between a green and a red photo-switchable dye, which should I select?\n",
